                    <p>Zespół Szkół im. Jana Pawła II in Niepołomice participated in the Erasmus +KA1 project entitled “Developing key competences for the interdisciplinary education of European citizens.” Within three years , from 2019 to 2022, school representatives participated in a variety of activities. <br><br>
                        Our school is constantly looking for new methods in order to make our educational offer more attractive, especially in view of the incoming educational reform in Poland. Our participation in the project called Erasmus + Staff Mobility has opened up a way for teachers take on new educational challenges. Our target was to extend our knowledge and master modern tools and teaching methods. Contemporary school is not only a place where students learn only theoretical knowledge, but it is a place where they learn the following competences: living in a society, solving problems, critical thinking, being able to work and contribute for the good of society. The activities envisaged in the Project’s framework have had positive effects not only on students’ and teachers’ personal development, but also on the whole school community and the local community. The acquired knowledge and experience have been implemented in order to better prepare our students for real life and to give them an incentive for cultural openness and tolerance. In today’s modern world it is not possible to educate young people without improving teaching skills especially with regard to the key competences, citizenship education and ICT. Contemporary teachers should improve their language skills as they are of great value as far as international cooperation with partner schools is concerned. 
                        <b>Teachers’ attitudes and their openness to innovation, as well as constant professional development, are key aspects of educational success.</b>
